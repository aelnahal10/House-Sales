    "# Session 1: Data Science Mindset + Pandas Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Data Science Actually Is\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is not a library, a model, or a notebook.\n",
    "It is a **decision-making discipline under uncertainty**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data scientist’s job is to:\n",
    "- Translate a vague real-world problem into a precise question\n",
    "- Decide what data is relevant and what is noise\n",
    "- Make assumptions explicit instead of hiding them in code\n",
    "- Test whether the data supports or contradicts those assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you jump to modeling, you are not doing data science.\n",
    "You are guessing with math.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How We Actually Work (At a High Level)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, data scientists work using **tools**.\n",
    "The tools are not the job — they support the thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mainly use:\n",
    "- **Python** → the programming language\n",
    "- **Libraries** → reusable code written by others\n",
    "- **Data structures** → organized ways to hold data\n",
    "\n",
    "You must understand these before doing anything meaningful.\n",
    "---\n",
    "## How We Run Python (Before Writing Any Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not run in the abstract.\n",
    "It runs inside an **environment** and is usually used through a **notebook or script**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t understand this, setups break and results become irreproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a Python Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Python environment** is:\n",
    "- A specific Python version\n",
    "- Plus a specific set of installed libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters:\n",
    "- Different projects need different library versions\n",
    "- Installing everything globally causes conflicts\n",
    "- “It works on my machine” usually means environments were ignored\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule:\n",
    "> One project → one environment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual environment** is an isolated Python environment for a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to:\n",
    "- Install libraries without breaking other projects\n",
    "- Reproduce results later\n",
    "- Share projects with others reliably\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually:\n",
    "- Global Python = operating system\n",
    "- Virtual environment = sandboxed workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "You do NOT need to master this today,\n",
    "but you must know why it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Jupyter Notebook** is an interactive coding environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It lets you:\n",
    "- Write code in small blocks (cells)\n",
    "- Run cells independently\n",
    "- See results immediately\n",
    "- Mix code, text, and outputs in one place\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why notebooks are used for:\n",
    "- Learning\n",
    "- Exploration\n",
    "- Data analysis\n",
    "- Prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "Not for:\n",
    "- Large software systems\n",
    "- Production services\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How a Jupyter Notebook Works\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is made of **cells**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types:\n",
    "- **Markdown cells** → explanations, notes, reasoning\n",
    "- **Code cells** → executable Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "Important rules:\n",
    "- Cells run top to bottom, but NOT automatically\n",
    "- Order matters\n",
    "- Variables persist in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Common beginner mistake:\n",
    "- Running cells out of order\n",
    "- Forgetting state exists\n",
    "- Getting confused by stale variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule:\n",
    "> Restart kernel + Run all is your truth test.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Python Kernel (Very Important)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **kernel** is the running Python process behind the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It holds variables in memory\n",
    "- It executes your code\n",
    "- If it crashes or restarts, all variables are lost\n",
    "\n",
    "When things behave strangely:\n",
    "- Restart the kernel\n",
    "- Run cells from the top\n",
    "\n",
    "If that fixes the issue, the problem was state, not logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How This Fits Into Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical setup:\n",
    "- One project folder\n",
    "- One virtual environment\n",
    "- One or more notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow:\n",
    "- Notebook → explore and understand data\n",
    "- Code → transform data into clean DataFrames\n",
    "- Later → models (not today)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools do not make you a data scientist.\n",
    "Understanding what they do — and their limits — does.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a Library?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **library** is a collection of pre-written code that solves common problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Instead of writing math from scratch → use a math library\n",
    "- Instead of writing data-loading logic → use a data library\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we use:\n",
    "- **pandas** → for working with data tables\n",
    "- **numpy** → for numerical operations (used under the hood)\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries save time.\n",
    "They do NOT replace thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "**pandas** is a Python library designed for:\n",
    "- Loading data from files (CSV, Excel, databases)\n",
    "- Inspecting and cleaning data\n",
    "- Transforming data into usable forms\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is used **before** machine learning.\n",
    "If pandas work is wrong, models will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **DataFrame** is pandas’ core data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a DataFrame as:\n",
    "- An Excel sheet\n",
    "- A SQL table\n",
    "- A structured data table\n",
    "\n",
    "It has:\n",
    "- **Rows** → observations (e.g., houses)\n",
    "- **Columns** → variables/features (e.g., price, size)\n",
    "\n",
    "Important:\n",
    "> Models do not see meaning.  \n",
    "> They only see numbers in a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your DataFrame is wrong, everything downstream is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Mental Loop (Non-Negotiable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every real project follows this loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem → Data → Assumptions → Cleaning → EDA → Features → Model → Evaluation → Iteration**\n",
    "\n",
    "You do NOT start at “Model”.\n",
    "If you do, every result is unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea:\n",
    "> Models do not create insight.  \n",
    "> Decisions made *before* the model do.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Is a Tool, Not the Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning exists to answer **one of three types of questions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question comes first.\n",
    "The algorithm comes last.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Supervised Learning (Target Exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "You already know what you want to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Input: house size, location, quality\n",
    "  - Target: house price\n",
    "\n",
    "If your dataset has a **target column**, you are in supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unsupervised Learning (No Target)\n",
    "\n",
    "You do NOT know the answer in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Group houses into similar segments\n",
    "  - Discover structure without labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning:\n",
    "- Requires more assumptions\n",
    "- Produces patterns, not truth\n",
    "- Is easier to misuse\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Types (Chosen by the Target)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **type of target** determines the problem type — not your preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "- Target is a number\n",
    "- Example: price, temperature, revenue\n",
    "- Question: “How much?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "- Target is a category\n",
    "- Example: cheap vs expensive, spam vs not spam\n",
    "- Question: “Which class?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering\n",
    "- No target\n",
    "- Output is structure, not correctness\n",
    "- Question: “What groups exist?”\n",
    "\n",
    "You do NOT choose the model first.\n",
    "You choose the **question** first.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The First Question You Always Ask\n",
    "\n",
    "Before touching pandas, sklearn, or charts, ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "**“What is the target, and why does it matter?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot answer this:\n",
    "- You cannot clean data correctly\n",
    "- You cannot evaluate results\n",
    "- You cannot explain outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Raw Data Is Always Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw data is never ready because:\n",
    "- Values are missing\n",
    "- Types are incorrect\n",
    "- Units are inconsistent\n",
    "- Outliers exist\n",
    "- Columns mix signal with noise\n",
    "- Data reflects how it was collected, not reality\n",
    "\n",
    "Every transformation you make encodes an assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good data scientists:\n",
    "- Know what assumptions they are making\n",
    "- Can explain them in plain language\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad data scientists:\n",
    "- Let libraries make assumptions for them\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules for This Session\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will NOT build models\n",
    "- We will NOT chase accuracy\n",
    "- We will focus on understanding the data\n",
    "- Every code step must answer a question\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot explain *why* you ran a line of code,\n",
    "that line should not exist.\n"
